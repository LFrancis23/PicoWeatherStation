# PicoWeatherStation
A Wireless Weather Station hosted on a Raspberry Pi Pico W. It reads a BME280 temperature, pressure, and humidity sensor, as well as a VEML7700 light sensor, and streams the data over a TCP socket to a Raspberry Pi 4. The data is stored in an SQL database, and hosted on my web server.
